Let's assume that we are designing API for sending of the Internet Group Management Protocol version 2 (IGMPv2)
packets over the network.
There are following simple requirements that should be fulfilled by the designed and implemented service API:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Service must be able to serialize IGMPv2 packets into the output buffer.
    \item Service must be able to serialize all types of IGMPv2 packets - Membership Query, Membership Report,
    and Leave Group message.
    \item Parameters of the IGMPv2 packet should be configurable by the client using human-readable values.
    \item If client does not specify any value for the parameter, default values should be used.
\end{itemize}
