Letâ€™s assume that we are designing an API for sending Internet Group Management Protocol version 2 (IGMPv2)
packets over the network.
The designed and implemented service API should fulfill the following simple requirements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item
    The service must be able to serialize IGMPv2 packets into the output buffer.
    \item
    The service must be able to serialize all types of IGMPv2 packets: Membership Query, Membership Report,
    and Leave Group message.
    \item
    Parameters of the IGMPv2 packet should be configurable by the client using human-readable values.
    \item
    If the client does not specify any value for the parameter, default values should be used.
\end{itemize}
