    abstract =  {This document specifies Version 3 of the Internet Group Management Protocol, IGMPv3. IGMP is the protocol used by IPv4 systems to report their IP multicast group memberships to neighboring multicast routers. Version 3 of IGMP adds support for 'source filtering', that is, the ability for a system to report interest in receiving packets *only* from specific source addresses, or from *all but* specific source addresses, sent to a particular multicast address. That information may be used by multicast routing protocols to avoid delivering multicast packets from specific sources to networks where there are no interested receivers. This document obsoletes RFC 2236.},

@book{fowler1999refactoring,
    abstract = {{Your class library works, but could it be better? \_Refactoring: Improving the
Design of Existing Code\_ shows how refactoring can make object-oriented code
simpler and easier to maintain. Today, refactoring requires considerable
design know-how, but once tools become available, all programmers should be
able to improve their code using refactoring techniques.

Besides an introduction to what refactoring is, this handbook provides a
catalogue of dozens of tips for improving code. The best thing about
\_Refactoring\_ is its remarkably clear presentation, along with excellent nuts-
and-bolts advice, from object expert Martin Fowler. The author is also an
authority on software patterns and UML, and this experience helps make this a
better book, one that should be immediately accessible to any intermediate or
advanced object-oriented developer. (Just like patterns, each refactoring tip
is presented with a simple name, a "motivation," and examples using Java and
UML.)

Early chapters stress the importance of testing in successful refactoring.
(When you improve code, you have to test to verify that it still works.) After
the discussion on how to detect the "smells" of bad code, readers get to the
heart of the book, its catalogue of more than 70 "refactorings"--tips for
better and simpler class design. Each tip is illustrated with "before" and
"after" code, along with an explanation. Later chapters provide a quick look
at refactoring research.

Like software patterns, refactoring may be an idea whose time has come. This
groundbreaking title will surely help bring refactoring to the programming
mainstream. With its clear advice on a hot new topic, \_Refactoring\_ is sure to
be essential reading for anyone who writes or maintains object- oriented
software. --\_Richard Dragan\_

**Topics Covered:** Refactoring, improving software code, redesign, design
tips, patterns, unit testing, refactoring research and tools.}},
